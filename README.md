## Description

This project implements the Raft consensus algorithm in Python. It incorporates concurrency features using signals and multiple Docker containers to ensure data consistency, log management, and uninterrupted leader election. MongoDB is used for log storage, ensuring reliable and efficient log management.

## Features

- **Raft Consensus Algorithm**: Ensures fault tolerance in distributed systems by managing leader election and log replication.
- **Concurrency**: Utilizes signals for handling concurrent operations and coordinating between different components.
- **Dockerized Containers**: Employs Docker to create isolated environments for different components of the system.
- **Log Management**: Logs are stored and managed using MongoDB to ensure consistency and durability.
- **Leader Election**: Implements a robust leader election process to handle node failures and ensure continuity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Docker
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/raft-algorithm.git
    cd raft-algorithm
    ```

2. **Set up Docker containers:**

    Ensure Docker is installed and running. Build and start the Docker containers using:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
